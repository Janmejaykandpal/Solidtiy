# Smart Contract Projects

This repository contains the source code and documentation for several smart contract projects developed on the Ethereum blockchain. The projects include an auction smart contract, lottery smart contract, and crowdfunding smart contract. These contracts were developed and deployed using the Solidity programming language, with deployment and testing performed using MetaMask and test networks.

## Projects

### Auction Smart Contract

The auction smart contract allows users to participate in bidding and determines the highest bidder. It provides a transparent and decentralized platform for conducting auctions securely.

### Lottery Smart Contract

The lottery smart contract randomly selects a winner from the participants. It ensures a fair and unbiased selection process, providing an exciting and decentralized lottery experience.

### Crowdfunding Smart Contract

The crowdfunding smart contract enables the collection of funds from contributors and releases them to the project upon meeting the funding goal. It offers a decentralized and trustless approach to crowdfunding, ensuring transparency and accountability.
